# BinaryOptions-BillyKay

This repository is dedicated to the legendary Binary Options Trader known as Billy Kay (from downunder Australia).

Billy unselfishly shared his trading strategy on BinaryOptionsEdge (BOE) community forum (already shutdown).  

Yes, there are many BO professional traders that will argue against technical indicators trading because all technical indicators by far, are lagger. Nevertheless, Billy's strategy using a combination of technical indicators is different.  He has invested a significant amount of times discovering this strategy, then went on to prove by trading live for a couple of years.  In fact, in his post (before BOE was shutdown), Billy mentioned that he is trading full time and has to bring food to his family of a wife and (two ?) kids. It is with such mindset that he needs to be profitable in his trading strategy.  

In his post, he also mentioned that with Patience, Discipline and Focus, he is able to achieve 100% winning rate.  Most of the followers have tried and believed that obtaining 80% winning rate is possible after a good amount of screen time investment.

Thank you Billy!
